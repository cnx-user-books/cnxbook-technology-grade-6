      <para id="id4888047">Every day you won beautiful large shooting marbles, which you showed, proudly to your dad at home. You did not take these prized possessions back to school, because you were afraid you would lose them. Unfortunately you forgot to put them in a safe place. Then one afternoon your mom spoke to you for the third consecutive day, because you had forgotten to take your marbles out of the pockets of your school trousers and they had landed in the washing machine. Your mom was very distressed because she had to call the plumber to see to the washing machine again. She warned you to get a container for your marbles, otherwise she would quietly make them disappear. You decided that this container would not be just an ordinary empty plastic bag, a glass, peanut butter jar or an empty coffee tin.</para>

      <para id="id3562198">It is already difficult to get up early for school in the winter, but if your hair elastics are always missing, especially when you are already late, it becomes necessary to make a plan. You regularly miss the school bus and then your mom has to take you to school in the old farm truck. You decide to design and make yourself a container that you can put on your dressing table next to your hairbrush, in which you can put your hair elastics the moment you remove them from your hair. You have a lovely big dam on the farm where you can find lots of clay. You want to make a container from clay. </para>

Archaeologists, who excavate antique civilisations, frequently find many objects and relics of clay, which prove that this is true.</para>
