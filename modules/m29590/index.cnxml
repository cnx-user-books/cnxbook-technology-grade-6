    <para id="id8582841">Hydraulics is the study of the movement of liquid and the utilisation of its force in the form of mechanical movement. Hydraulics is based on the principle that force can be transferred by a liquid. Hydraulic machines have parts that can be controlled by making use of a liquid under pressure. A hydraulic system contains a pipe that is filled with a liquid such as oil, and a valve/piston that moves to and fro in the pipe. When the liquid in the pipe is put under pressure, it causes the valve/piston to move, which sends the force from one end of the pipe to the other.</para>
    <para id="id8325269">Pneumatic systems have parts that can be controlled through compressed air. In a pneumatic system, air causes the piston/valve to move and thus the force is carried over from one position to the other. A bicycle pump and a vacuum cleaner are pneumatic systems because each has a pump that transfers air from one place to another and thus transfers a specific force. In a vacuum cleaner a pump sucks air from an area, and this creates a vacuum. Dust from outside is then sucked into the vacuum in order to fill the area.</para>
    <para id="id1169038308758">If we have to move heavy objects by making use of a compressed liquid we use a ____________system. Extremely powerful machines that can press, push or lift, operate hydraulically. A hydraulic system greatly increases the force that an object exerts. </para>

    <para id="id1169038402355">Why does it work?</para>
    <para id="id6207896">It is difficult to compress water. When you put water under high pressure in one place, it will flow out with the same force elsewhere. The water therefore transfers the force from one tin to the other. All hydraulic machines work on this principle.</para>
    <para id="id1169036171774">Background</para>
    <para id="id6131748">Powerful bulldozers, fire engines and cranes use hydraulic power to lift heavy loads easily. A liquid is carried from a pump by means of pipes to cylinders where the liquid pushes valves/pistons out with great force. The pistons force the shovel into the soil and a heavy load of soil can thus be lifted. (A valve causes air or a liquid to move in one direction, but also prevents air or water from flowing back again.)</para>
    <para id="id1169044061342">The advantage of making use of air pressure is that air is clean, freely available and safe under low pressure. Under high pressure air can be very dangerous. By nature air is resilient and this can cause a problem</para>
    <para id="id8514381">Hydraulic systems are sometimes better than pneumatic systems because motion can be obtained more easily. When a leak occurs in a hydraulic system, it could be very messy.</para>
